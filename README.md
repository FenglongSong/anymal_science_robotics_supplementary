## Demenstration

This folked repo is used to store the training data into csv format for training. Run `save_highspeed_data_to_csv.m` and `save_walk_data_to_csv.m` in `actuator_model` folder. The csv files are store in `actuator_model/data_csv` folder.

**Notice**: walking data is collected from LF_KFE and high speed data is collected from LH_KFE joint.
